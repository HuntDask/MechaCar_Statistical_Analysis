### Linear Regression to Predict MPG
- From our created summary, we can see that the vehicle lenght and the ground clearance were the varaibles/coefficients that helped to represent the non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset
- When we are able to convert to scientific notation, we can see that even though some of the slopes of the linear model are close, none of them are considered to be zero. This is because we can test the linear regression formula for mpg and it does not result in the slope being zero.
- From what we summarized, we can see that the Multiple R-squared came out to be 0.7149, which is pretty effective for the dataset. This is not the only effective way to determine, but it does represent one of the biggest considerations as far as determining the effectivness with the linear model mpg.<img width="892" alt="Deliverable 1 " src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107444840/198161140-17d6347d-c121-4323-b0d6-01dfcaa36b2d.png">

### Summary Statistics on Suspension Coils
- As we can see through our image and our data collected, the variance is at about 62 which is lower than 100 pounds per square inch. From the following image we collected of the different lots, we see that lot 1 and 2 are very low compared to lot 3 at about 170 variance. lot 3 does exceed our 100 pounds per square inch compared to the other two lots.

### T-Tests on Suspension Coils
- When we collected our t tests on suspension coils for lots 1-3, we are able to see see that the lots 1 and 2 had an even and normal rate of disturbtion with their P values being over the 0.05 mark. However, in lot 3, we can see when we run our delieverable that the value of the p is lower than the 0.05 mark of the interval.
